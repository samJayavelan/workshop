# Sample3
Sample3 is the next generation calculator. Move over Personal Computer?
And, say hello to the Personal Calculator...or maybe it will say `Hello` to you.
Interestingly, this calculator doesn't do much calculation but it's really good at greeting you.

## Background
For some reason, this calculator might have a bug that our developer Syn has been chasing down.
There have been reports that this calculator greets you like a pirate...not expected. Mr. Tax has been able to figure
out that this was due to a race condition and has fixed the problem. Or did he?
