# Sample4
Sample4 is a calculator program built on primitives. The primitive operation is addition where it is used for subtraction (with negation) and division (repeated subtraction). Repeated addition (multiplication) is less interesting so the Product Owner left that feature out.

## Background
Does this have a bug? Maybe...maybe not. But there are definitely some dependencies.
And that division function...wow, does that thing have some heavy logic. I wonder how complex it is?
